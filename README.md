# piazza_markov
Simple markov chain based text emulator for Piazza posts for AC209a in Fall 2017 at Harvard

To get this data I used the piazza-api package, and I scraped only public posts that did not contain the instructor tag.  The motivation for dropping the instructor tag was to get a sample of text that was predominantly from the students asking questions of the faculty and TF's. The model is a simple n-gram markov chain based on the corpus of text from the piazza posts.

Something about the item above - is the regularization parameter? I waited 20 mins already.. and restarted several times... is it ok to have unrestricted depth.&#34; Setting a max_depth on any Linux machine to set a max depth is clearly over-fitting the training data then compute train R2 and test

part of it is missing after part(h). Is it intentional or accidental?Maybe I&#39;m reading into this wrong, but are the labels correct? It looks like in my code (which is really short code, so that surprises me... it is usually much easier to make a larger dataset to train on.

submit hw individually, would the notebooks be graded individually or would only one of the notebooks be graded? The video labeled &#34;section 4&#34; appears to be section 3, and for some reason, the APCOMP 209 sections are labeled as sections 3 and 5. Is this correct?to answer those questions, could
